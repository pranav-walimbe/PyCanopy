# SpatialBench ground-truth answers

Reference results for the SpatialBench queries. A downstream CI job
(`verify_results.py`) reuses the benchmark run's result dumps — instead of
re-executing any query — and compares each engine's result against these answers.
A mismatch **fails CI**.

## Layout

```
benchmark/answers/
  sf1/                          # scale factor 1
    q1.parquet   q1.csv
    q2.parquet   q2.csv
    ...
    q12.parquet  q12.csv
  sf10/                         # scale factor 10
    q1.parquet   q1.csv
    ...
    q12.parquet  q12.csv
```

Each query's expected result is committed in two formats, written from the same
normalized frame:

- **`q<n>.parquet`** — the type-faithful canonical answer (timestamps stay
  timestamps, ints stay ints). The verify job reads this to know each column's type,
  so comparison semantics come from the schema: integer keys/counts, timestamps and
  strings are matched exactly, and only floating-point metrics use tolerance.
- **`q<n>.csv`** — a review companion: GitHub renders it as a table and diffs are
  readable when an answer changes.

The benchmark run dumps each engine's result to a csv (never parquet), so no pyarrow
filesystem is touched inside a SedonaDB worker; the engine-free verify job then reads
the answer parquet (types) and that csv (values) and compares them.

Most queries are bounded to at most 100 rows (see #124), so the fixtures are tiny. The one
exception is **Q4**, which groups the top-1000 tipped trips by zone and returns one row per
zone (~260 at SF1, ~240 at SF10); it is inherently small and bounded (never more than the
number of zones touched by 1000 trips) but is not capped at 100.

## How they are generated

- **SedonaDB is the reference oracle** — the answers are the output of the canonical
  SedonaDB dialect on the SpatialBench dataset, produced by the benchmark run in CI (the
  `--result-dir` dumps), not on a local machine.
- **SF1** was generated with SedonaDB 0.4.0.
- **SF10** was generated with SedonaDB 0.3.0. SedonaDB 0.4.0 cannot compute Q5 at SF10 —
  its grouped convex-hull aggregation spills >100 GB and aborts
  ([apache/sedona-db#1077](https://github.com/apache/sedona-db/issues/1077)) — while 0.3.0
  computes it in modest space. The two versions produce identical results for the other 11
  queries at SF10, so the values are version-independent; only Q5's feasibility differs.
- **Cross-check:** the correctness verify job runs every participating engine against these
  answers, so each committed answer is independently validated by the other engines (e.g.
  DuckDB) wherever they can compute the query.

## Canonical, engine-neutral form

Engines represent some types differently, so answers are normalized before writing:

- **Durations/intervals → total seconds** (float), with a `_seconds` column suffix
  (e.g. `avg_duration` → `avg_duration_seconds`).
- **Decimals → float**.
- **Timestamps → `datetime`** (preserved as timestamps in parquet; ISO-8601 in csv).

Row order is significant and preserved: every query has a deterministic `ORDER BY`
(with key tiebreakers) followed by `LIMIT`, so the expected rows and their order are
well defined.

## Comparison semantics

Columns are compared by position (engines name columns differently, e.g.
`avg_duration` vs `avg_duration_seconds`), with:

- Integer keys, strings, and timestamps: exact match.
- Floats (distances, areas, IoU, seconds): relative + absolute tolerance
  (`rtol=1e-6`, `atol=1e-9`) to absorb cross-engine floating-point differences.
- The final row may legitimately differ across engines when a float metric ties near
  the `LIMIT` boundary; a within-tolerance boundary difference is treated as a pass.

An engine that cannot compute a query (timeout / error / OOM, e.g. DuckDB's Q12
below) is reported but does **not** fail the job — that is a runtime issue surfaced
by the benchmark summary, not a wrong answer. Only an actual mismatch fails CI.

## Caveat: Q12 at SF1

DuckDB has no KNN operator, so its Q12 uses a lateral cross-join that is infeasible at
SF1 (it does not finish in reasonable time). Q12 is therefore **not** cross-checked by
DuckDB here — it is validated by the KNN-capable engines (SedonaDB, Spatial Polars,
PyCanopy). In the verify job, DuckDB's Q12 shows as "could not compute" rather than a
failure.

CSV, Parquet, and comparison rules together when advancing the workload revision.
